Steps to setup the project (We are assuming that, you have already installed node.js)

(Note: if you are seting up project in linux based os / mac os, you may face some permission issue. In such case just add 'sudo' as prefix to npm install.

1. Clone the repo and go inside the root directory
2. Install bower and npm dependencies by running below commands

npm install
bower install

3. Install gulp globally

npm install --global gulp-cli

4. Once it's done, run 'gulp serve' command, and open 'http://localhost:3000/' in browser.
